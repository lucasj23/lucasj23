I'm a passionate Data Analyst who loves working with data to extract relevant and valuable insights. I'm excited about exploring datasets, applying analytical techniques, and effectively visualizing the results. Currently, I'm also diving into the world of machine learning to create predictive models and classifications. In this space, I'll be sharing projects, scripts, and analyses that reflect my dedication to data analytics and my journey into the realm of machine learning.
