### Hi there 👋

I’m Lucas — a Data Analyst with a strong background in Supply Chain Analytics and growing experience in Analytics Engineering.
I work with AWS (Athena, S3, Glue), SQL, Python, and QuickSight to build scalable analytical solutions and high-complexity dashboards using LAC functions and multi-granularity data models.

Here I share projects, scripts, and analytical workflows that reflect my focus on:
• transforming raw data into actionable insights
• building reliable and scalable data solutions
• combining analytics, data modeling, and visualization
